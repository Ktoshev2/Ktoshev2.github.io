        <h1>Welcome to Web 2!</h1>
        <h4>Today, we will mess with some Pseudo Classes and Elements</h4>

        <h2>Let's first dive deeper into CSS</h2>
        <p>If we think of CSS in terms of selectors, properties, and values, then a typical CSS entry would look like this:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                selector {property: value;}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>To style the above, we need to add two tags together. We call this CSS Combinators</p>
        
        <h2>What are Pseudo Classes?</h2>
        <p>Again, if we think of CSS in terms of selectors, properties, and values, then a pseudo classe is an add-on to a selector</p>
        <p>A typical CSS entry calling on Pseudo Class would look like this:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                selector:pseudo_class {property: value;}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h4>We use Pseudo Class for Links</h4>
        <p>If we want our <a href="https://www.google.com/">links</a> to look different, we can simply add it in to the CSS as follows:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                a {color: red;}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>If we want our <a href="#">link states</a> to look different then will use a pseudo class like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>:visited</li>
            <li>:hover</li>
            <li>:active</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But we can also make a <a class="special" href="#">new link</a> look different.</p>

        <h4>We can even call on specific selectors depending on their heirarchy.</h4>
        <div id="first">
            <p>This text will change</p>
            <p>This will look different</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What are Pseudo Elements?</h2>
        <p id="pseudo-elements">If we think of pseudo classes as add-ons, then we can think of pseudo elements as creating new elements from a selector.</p>

        <h2>My Additional CW Stuff:</h2>
        <div id="indentation">
            <p>This is at a normal depth</p>
            <p>This is indented</p>
            <p>This is even more indented!</p>
            <p>This is boring</p>
        </div>
